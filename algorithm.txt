#Functions's purpose: read in a file name from the user and return it once they give one that exists
1. define a function with no parameters that obtains user input for the variable file_name.
2. if file_Notfound = True, enter while loop which continues asking user for file_name input until file_Notfound = False.
3. Return file_name once file_Notfound = False.
#Parameters: None
#Return: file name





#Function's purpose: Process the file
#Parameters: file name of file to read from
#Return: The maximum profit
1. define a function with the parameter file_name.
2. open file_name for reading.
3. set max_profit = 0, then use for loop to read each line of file_name and separate the movie info with: movie_info = "release_date, title, budget, boxoffice_gross"
then: release_date, title, budget, boxoffice_gross = movie_info.split(",").
4. profit = boxoffice_gross - budget
5. if profit > max_profit:
     max_profit = profit
6. return max_profit



#Function's purpose: Process the file
#Parameters: file name of file to read from, file name of file to write to
1. define a function named info_file with the parameter file_name
2. open the file for reading
3. have user input the file name to save movie info to
4. then open the file for writing
5. create a for loop that uses, "release_date, title, budget, boxoffice_gross = line.split(",")""
5. make boxoffice_gross a float
6. make budge a float
7. print to file the release date, title, profit,


#Function's purpose: main
#Parameters: None
1. define a function named main
2. set the movie_file_input equal to the file_name_input()
3. set max_profit equal to max(movie_file_input)
4. create a print function that output the max_profit
5. then set the movie_info_file equal to info_file(movie_file_input)
#Return: None
