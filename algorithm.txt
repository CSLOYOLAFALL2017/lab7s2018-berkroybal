#Functions's purpose: read in a file name from the user and return it once they give one that exists
1. define a function with no parameters that obtains user input for the variable file_name.
2. if file_Notfound = True, enter while loop which continues asking user for file_name input until file_Notfound = False.
3. Return file_name once file_Notfound = False.
#Parameters: None
#Return: file name




#Function's purpose: Process the file
#Parameters: file name of file to read from
#Return: The maximum profit
1. define a function with the parameter file_name.
2. open file_name for reading.
3. set max_profit = 0, then use for loop to read each line of file_name and separate the movie info with: movie_info = "release_date, title, budget, boxoffice_gross"
then: release_date, title, budget, boxoffice_gross = movie_info.split(",").
4. profit = boxoffice_gross - budget
5. if profit > max_profit:
     max_profit = profit
6. return max_profit



#Function's purpose: Process the file
#Parameters: file name of file to read from, file name of file to write to
#Return: None




#Function's purpose: main
#Parameters: None
